# BigBoiBot
Just a fun lil bot.

##  Extra Files
For Big Boi Bot to run, you need to put the proper info into a configu.txt file in the same directory as the Python script file (sample file provided), and put your bot token in a token.txt file in the same directory as the Python script file. Replace the paths where Python reads the txt files with your own.
