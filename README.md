# BigBoiBot
Just a fun lil bot. Features include: sending reminders, which are backed up in a JSON file, sending the weather (in the US), and other dumb stuff.

##  Extra Files
For Big Boi Bot to run, you need to put the proper info into a configu.txt file in the same directory as the Python script file (sample file provided), and put your bot token in a token.txt file in the same directory as the Python script file. Also needs an empty reminders.json file. Replace the paths where Python reads the txt and json files with your own.
